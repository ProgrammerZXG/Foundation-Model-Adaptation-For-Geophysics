## :sparkles: Introduction
<p align="justify">
Workflow for adapting pre-trained foundation models to geophysics.
First, we prepare geophysical training datasets (1st column), 
which involves collecting and processing relevant geophysical data 
to ensure it is suitable for adaption fine-tuning. Next, we load the pre-trained 
foundation model as the data feature encoder (2nd column) 
and fine-tune the model to make it adaptable to geophysical data. 
To map the encoder features to the task-specific targets, 
we explore suitable decoders 
(3rd column) for geophysical downstream adaption. Finally, the adapted model 
is applied to various downstream tasks within the geophysics 
field (4th column).
